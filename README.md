# Buffer Overflow

.AKA programming in C, disassembling the binary on an old version of Ubuntu and hopefully finding some memory corruptions, so we can exploit!

.We will use gcc -m32 -g to compile the c program into an elf 32bit executable to facilitate the analysis of the assembly code.
. This is an example about a fundamental vulnerability called buffer overflow
