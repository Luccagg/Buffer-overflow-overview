![t](img/1.png)
.AKA programming in C, disassembling the binary on an old version of Ubuntu and hopefully finding some memory corruptions, so we can exploit!
A buffer overflow is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is passed into memory without verification if the size of input is equal or less than the size of the buffer allocated to him by the programmer.
